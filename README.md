```
Multiple regression - FALSE
Correlation - FALSE
Decision tree - FALSE
Linear regression - TRUE
```

### Core Learning Algorithms: Working With Data
What is categorical data?
```
Another term for one-hot encoding. - FALSE
Any data that is not numeric. - TRUE 
Any data that is represented numerically. - FALSE
```
### Core Learning Algorithms: The Training Process
What are epochs?
```
The number of times the model will see the same data. - TRUE
A type of graph. - FALSE
The number of elements you feed to the model at once. - FALSE
```

### Core Learning Algorithms: Classification
What is classification?
```
The process of separating data points into different classes. - TRUE
Predicting a numeric value or forecast based on independent and dependent variables. - FALSE
None of the above. - FALSE
```

### Core Learning Algorithms: Building the Model
What kind of estimator/model does TensorFlow recommend using for classification?
```
LinearClassifier - FALSE
DNNClassifier - TRUE
BoostedTreesClassifier - FALSE
```

### Core Learning Algorithms: Clustering
Which of the following steps is not part of the K-Means algorithm?
```
Randomly pick K points to place K centeroids.
Assign each K point to the closest K centeroid.
Move each K centeroid into the middle of all of their data points.
Shuffle the K points so they're redistributed randomly. - not part of the k-means algorithm
Reassign each K point to the closest K centeroid.
```

### Core Learning Algorithms: Hidden Markov Models
What makes a Hidden Markov model different than linear regression or classification?
```
It uses probability distributions to predict future events or states. - TRUE
It analyzes the relationship between independent and dependent variables to make predictions. - FALSE
It separates data points into separate categories. - FALSE
```

### Core Learning Algorithms: Using Probabilities to make Predictions
